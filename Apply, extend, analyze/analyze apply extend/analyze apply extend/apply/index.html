        <p>When it comes to planning on building a website, you must first know what website you're trying to create, then figure out what kind of visual design you would like to use when making this website. From there, create a wireframe and  a site map. Then start implementing those ideas into code.</p>
        
        <p>From chapter 1, I learned that it's very important to know who you're making a website for in terms of who's viewing, and that the layout of the site has to be different depending on the platform they are using.</p>
