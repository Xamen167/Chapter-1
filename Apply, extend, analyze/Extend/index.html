        <p>From what I read, Guideline 1.1 gives us diffferent examples of alternative text content, such as inputs, timed media, or visuals.</p>
    
        <p>From what I read, Guideline 1.2 shows different examples for alternatives for time-based media, like captions or sign language as an audio descripton.</p>
        
        <p>From what I read, Guideline 1.3 shows us how the same content can be presented in different formats without losing its structure, providing examples of these different aspects that ensure the content won't be cluttered.</p>
        
        <p>From what I read, Guideline 1.4 shows us what different elements can make it easier for users to see and hear content, such as specific use of color or audio control</p>
